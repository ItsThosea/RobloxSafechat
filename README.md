## Minecraft Safechat
*Today we answer a question nobody ever asked for an answer to...*   
Remember Roblox's old safechat feature from 2007-2014?

**What if it was in Minecraft?**

Well, with this mod, wonder no more!  
This mod adds every single one of Roblox's old safechat texts into Minecraft, plus some extras!<br>

Is it too big or too small? Don't want messages to auto-send? Or want to configure something else?  
Look no further than the configuration menu!

Or maybe you want to change the messages you can chat with?! Then you would go to the [messages file!](https://github.com/ItsThosea/RobloxSafechat/wiki/Message-file)<br>
